# 3D-Object_Detection
3D Object Detection system using MediaPipe Objectron for video-based object localization and pose estimation with 3D bounding box visualization.

📌 Project Overview

This project implements real-time 3D object detection on video input using MediaPipe Objectron.
The system detects specific object categories and estimates their 3D bounding boxes and pose information from 2D video frames.

The model processes a video file frame-by-frame, performs object detection, and visualizes:

- 2D bounding boxes

- 3D bounding boxes

- Object keypoints

- Rotation & translation vectors


🛠️ Tech Stack

  - Python 3.x

  - MediaPipe (Objectron)

  - OpenCV

  - NumPy

⚠️NOTE: Detection works only for supported categories.
